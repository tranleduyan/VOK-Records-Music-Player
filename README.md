# About:
This is a music player made specifically for a group of Vietnamese artists. The music player can be used by their fans for a faster access since finding songs that are scattering around in multiple music sites like Spotify, SoundCloud, or Youtube would be hard and inconvenient. This music player is the one to show their love and care to people who love them in finding lyrics for each of their song, hidden gems that are buried or anything the fans need with their musics.
